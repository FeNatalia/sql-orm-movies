This is a small project from The Treehouse "Using SQL ORMs with Node.js" Course

In this course, I learned how to use the Sequelize ORM to leverage SQL within a Node.js application, including:

- Defining models
- Connecting to a SQL database
- Creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data (CRUD Operations)
